## 🧠 How It Works

- Calculator logic is handled by a `Calculator` class managing inputs, operations, and display updates.
- Button inputs are connected via `data-*` attributes.
- Background color changes every 30 seconds using a timer and a predefined palette of soft colors.
- Transitions are applied for smooth visual effects.
